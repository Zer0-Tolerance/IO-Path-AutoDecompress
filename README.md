NAME
====

IO::Path::AutoDecompress - IO::Path with automatic decompression

SYNOPSIS
========

```raku
use IO::Path::AutoDecompress;
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

IO::Path::AutoDecompress is a module that provides a subclass to `IO::Path`, that will transparently handle compressed files that are compressed with `gzip` (the `.gz` file extension) or `bzip2` (the `.bz2` extension) for the `.slurp` and `.lines` methods.

PREREQUISITES
=============

This module assumes some version of the `gunzip` and `bunzip2` programs can be executed with the `--stdout` argument.
